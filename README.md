# Bootstrap-Responsive-Portfolio
A responsive portfolio utilizing Bootstrap: https://mandisareed.github.io/Bootstrap-Responsive-Portfolio/

This repository serves as the foundation for building my professional porfolio as a web developer. I implemented my knowledge of Bootstrap layouts and styling to create a responsive webpage on multiple viewports. My biggest challenge was linking all three pages so that their links in the navigation bar worked successfully.
